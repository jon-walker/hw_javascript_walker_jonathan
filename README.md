I had a lot of trouble for the last requirement. I found a way to nest a function within a function to make it print to the console correctly, but I could not make it work with the set-up that was specified in the instructions.

Errors kept coming up about the display variable not being defined which confused me because I thought it was defined when the function is invoked. So that would be really helpful to get feedback about how it should have looked.
